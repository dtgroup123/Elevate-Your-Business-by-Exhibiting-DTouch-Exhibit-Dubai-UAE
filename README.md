The bridge between missions and actual exhibitions is generally an exhibition plan. Most museums have five-year exhibition plans. Some, especially those with plans for major reinstallation of permanent exhibitions, project 10 years out. The 5-10-year timeframe is partly because of the lead-time required to develop and fund projects. The plans are, however, flexible enough to allow for both serendipity and a response to unanticipated events.&lt;br>  &lt;b>Conclusion:&lt;/b> DTouchExhibit is a well reputed exhibition stand builder in Dubai.
